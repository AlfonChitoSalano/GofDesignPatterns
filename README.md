# Gang of Four Design Patterns in C#
Coding some of the design patterns using C# 11.0. The intention of this is to code some of the common design patterns using the updated C# version

## Creational
### Singleton 
The intent of this is to create a single instance of the object throughout the application.

### Factory 
The intent of this is to create the interface, letting you create subclasses or polymorphism without exposing interface internal creation.

## Structural
### Adapter 
The intent of this is to convert the interface that clients expect that couldn't be because of incompatible interfaces.

## Behavioral
### Observer 
The intent of this is to provide loose coupling between a notifier to listeners. If the notifier changes its state then all listeners are notified. Some called this pub/sub.
